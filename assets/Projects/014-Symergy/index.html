            Symergy is a challenging "Die and Retry" platformer with a unique core mechanic: "As above, so below" (inspired by the theme of Epic Games' MegaJam 2022). You control a character who can switch between two parallel worldsâ€”one of light above and one of darkness below. Actions in one world have distinct consequences in the other, requiring players to think strategically and master the interplay between both realms. Developed within a week alongside 4 collaborators.
