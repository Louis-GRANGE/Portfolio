            "REEM" is a Real-Time Strategy (RTS) game developed in a team of 17 collaborators over a period of two weeks. The project involved a mix of 8 modellers and 9 programmers, and focused on creating a dynamic and engaging gameplay experience. As part of the programming team, I worked with two other collaborators to bring the NPCs to life, ensuring they interacted seamlessly within the game environment.
